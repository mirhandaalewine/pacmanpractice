# PacMan Exercise
## What it is:
The goal of this exercise was to write code that took four images of PacMan to create the illusion of PacMan moving back and forth across the screen, opening and closing his mouth as he goes. This project allowed for additional practice with JavaScript functions, arrays, and conditionals.
## Where it will go:
In the future, I would like to continue to build out this file to include responsive features that would allow for gameplay. The goal is for PacMan to move with a user's mouse to collect tokens on the screen.
